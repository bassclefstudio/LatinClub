These shirts have been designed by the Latin Club, with an amazing design on the back of the shirt by Kirsten Tiangco![^1] They're available for any Latin student, regardless of whether you're in the Latin Club, Latin class, or just a fan of Roman culture, and celebrate the... *uniqueness* of the year 2020. To order a shirt, fill out the form below with your email, payment, and sizing information. Submission closes **March 19th** (shirts should arrive in early April).
